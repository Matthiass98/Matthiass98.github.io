        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm currently diving deep into the world of digital forensics as a student, driven by a relentless curiosity and an unwavering commitment to learning. My journey is fueled by a fascination with technology and a passion for unraveling the complex puzzles that digital evidence presents.

            As part of the Ghent local police's digital forensics team, I blend my academic knowledge with practical experiences to tackle real-world challenges. This unique position allows me to apply cutting-edge forensic techniques directly to our investigations, ensuring we stay ahead in the fast-paced digital arena.
            
            Collaboration and continuous learning are at the core of my approach. I thrive on the exchange of ideas with peers and mentors, constantly seeking new ways to enhance my skills and contribute more effectively to our collective mission of upholding justice.
            
            Balancing my studies with hands-on investigative work, I'm committed to making a meaningful impact in the field of digital forensics, one case at a time. Off duty, you'll find me exploring Ghent, always on the lookout for new insights and inspirations.
            
            Looking forward to the next challenge and opportunity to learn!</p>
